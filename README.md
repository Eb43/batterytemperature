<p>This Android app that displays the smartphone's battery temperature in real-time. The battery temperature can be seen directly in the notification shade or status bar, offering a quick glance without any efforts.</p>

<p>Knowing your battery's temperature can help to maintain the overall health and longevity of the battery. If the battery overheats over 40 degrees Celsius, it degrades faster. In extreme cases of temperature over 50 degrees Celsius the battery may catch on fire. </p>

<p>The app is particularly helpful for users who want to:</p>

<ul>
<li> Prevent battery degradation caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures.</li>
<li> Identify when their phone may be getting too hot.</li>
<li> Monitor their device during charging or use in hot environments, ensuring they can take action if the temperature rises beyond safe levels.</li>
<li> Use Android phone as an ambient temperature thermometer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Battery Temperature Display</strong> app is designed to provide users with real-time battery temperature data for Android smartphones, offering valuable insights into device health and performance. The temperature reading is conveniently displayed in three key locations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The app’s main screen for quick access.</li>
<li>A persistent notification in the Android notification area.</li>
<li>Directly in the Android system status bar for continuous monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive and minimalistic user interface.</li>
<li>Autostart feature ensures the app runs automatically on boot.</li>
<li>Does not run hidden services or background processes, ensuring efficient resource use.</li>
<li>Exits completely upon button press, freeing system memory.</li>
<li>Consumes minimal RAM, making it ideal for older and low-powered devices.</li>
<li>Free to use with no unnecessary permissions required.</li>
<li>Compatible with Android 8 and newer versions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Information</h2>
<p>The app retrieves battery temperature data from system files within the directory:</p>
<pre>/sys/class/power_supply/battery/</pre>

<p>The specific file used for temperature readings is <code>temp</code>, which reports values in tenths of degrees Celsius. For instance, a recorded value of <code>350</code> corresponds to an actual temperature of <strong>35.0°C</strong>.</p>

<h3>Accuracy of Battery Temperature Readings</h3>
<p>Battery temperature readings are highly reliable since they originate from internal battery sensors embedded within modern smartphones. However, small variations can occur due to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sensor calibration differences between device manufacturers.</li>
<li>Ambient temperature affecting thermal dissipation.</li>
<li>CPU and GPU workload causing localized heating near the battery.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Determines Battery Temperature</h3>
<p>Battery temperature changes gradually due to the large mass of the battery. A smartphone battery typically weighs around 30-40 grams. Factors influencing temperature include:</p>


<h2>Practical Benefits of Monitoring Battery Temperature</h2>
<p>Understanding battery temperature is essential for ensuring optimal smartphone performance and battery longevity. Here’s how monitoring battery temperature can be useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Prevent Overheating:</strong> Excessive heat can degrade battery cells, leading to shorter battery life and potential safety risks.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized Charging:</strong> Charging a hot battery accelerates wear, making it crucial to monitor temperature during charging sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Gaming and Intensive Apps:</strong> High-performance applications generate substantial heat. Monitoring temperature helps users adjust usage accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying Hardware Issues:</strong> Unusual temperature spikes may indicate faulty components, a defective battery, or excessive background processes.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency in Cold Environments:</strong> Extreme cold can reduce battery efficiency and cause unexpected shutdowns. Keeping track of temperature assists in avoiding performance drops.</li>
</ul>

<p>With its reliable data, minimal footprint, and ease of use, the Battery Temperature Display app offers essential insights into the health of your device’s power system.</p>
