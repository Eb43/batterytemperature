# Android battery temperature

This Android app that displays the smartphone's battery temperature in real-time. The battery temperature can be seen directly in the notification shade or status bar, offering a quick glance without any efforts.

Knowing your battery's temperature can help to maintain the overall health and longevity of the battery. If the battery overheats over 40 degrees Celsius, it degrades faster. In extreme cases of temperature over 50 degrees Celsius the battery may catch on fire. 

The app is particularly helpful for users who want to:

- Prevent battery degradation caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures.
- Identify when their phone may be getting too hot.
- Monitor their device during charging or use in hot environments, ensuring they can take action if the temperature rises beyond safe levels.
- Use Android phone as an ambient temperature thermometer.
